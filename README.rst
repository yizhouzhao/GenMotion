`GenMotion` (/genâ€™motion/) is a Python library for making skeletal animations. 
It enables easy dataset loading and experiment sharing for synthesizing skeleton-Based human animation with the Python API. It also comes with a easy-to-use and industry-compatible API for `Autodesk Maya <https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription>`_,
`Maxon Cinema 4D <https://www.maxon.net/en/cinema-4d>`_, and `Blender <https://www.blender.org/>`_.

You can find the full ducumentation and tutorials `here <https://genmotion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Installation
============

You can install ``GenMotion`` directly from the pip library with:

.. code:: shell

    pip3 install genmotion



Library overview
================

Working with datasets
---------------------
We integrate multiple skeleton-based human motion datasets in GenMotion.
For datasets that have different parameterization of the body, we include 
documents for meta-data descriptions and visualization tools to illustrate characteristics of each dataset.

Benchmarking the state-of-the-arts
----------------------------------
To encourage related research in human motion generation and retrieve empirical results from most advanced methods,
GenMotion re-produces the training procedure of character motion generation methods by reusing and cleaning the code from official implementation.

Rendering
---------
To achieve real-time animation sampling, we provide communication interface, i.e. client and server interaction,  
with the 3D modeling software in GenMotion.
